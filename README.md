# bayesian-class

this is homework number 1.
I used airquality data and carried out a simple linear regression model.
My model used Ozone level as outcome variable and Wind level as predictor variable.
I plotted Wind level against Ozone level and added a regression line to it.
I also included a plot to check the usual assumptions of regression analysis.
